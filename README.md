# a11y-scan

Automated web accessibility (a11y) scanning tool using **Playwright** and **axe-core**, with a clean browser-based launcher, detailed HTML reports, and CSV/JSON exports aligned to **WCAG** guidelines.

This project focuses on **real-world usability**: handling messy user input, running stable scans, and producing reports that are easy to review and share.

## Reports are automatically organized and served by the launcher:

reports/
├─ index.html # Dashboard (multi-scan)
├─ latest.html # Most recent scan (HTML)
├─ latest.json
├─ latest.csv
└─ YYYY/
└─ MM/
├─ timestamp_site_a11y.html
├─ timestamp_site_a11y.json
└─ timestamp_site_a11y.csv

Each HTML report includes:
- Severity badges
- Rule descriptions
- Affected selectors
- Direct links to Deque rule documentation
- Download links for CSV and JSON

## 🧠 Design Goals

This project was built to demonstrate:

Practical accessibility automation

Defensive input handling

Stable Playwright usage

Clear, human-readable output

End-to-end system integration (UI → API → Python → Reports)

It is intentionally not a SaaS or hosted service — the focus is on tooling quality and reliability.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Some enterprise sites may block automated browsers

CAPTCHA or login-gated pages may fail to scan

Sequential scanning prioritizes stability over speed

These behaviors are handled gracefully and reported without crashing.
